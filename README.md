# BudgetPro Monorepo

<!-- Replace with actual owner/repo once pushed -->

![CI](https://github.com/REPLACE_ME_OWNER/REPLACE_ME_REPO/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Monorepo for the BudgetPro application (web + desktop + backend) per `docs/requirements.md` & `docs/tasks.md`.

## Structure (Initial Skeleton)

```
apps/                # Application entry points (web SPA, electron, later workers)
packages/            # Shared libraries (domain types, services, ui components)
tools/               # Build & dev scripts
docs/                # Requirements, ADRs, security & task docs (policy docs will live in .github/)
docs/adr/            # Architecture decision records (to be added starting T-020)
```

Current scaffold directories created per T-001. `.github/` (policy & workflow) will be added in a later governance task (not required by T-001 spec but referenced in plan and copilot instructions).

## Workspace

Initialized pnpm workspace (T-002). Root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines package globs. Root scripts are placeholders until tooling tasks (T-003+).

## Getting Started (Will Evolve)

1. Ensure Node.js LTS & pnpm installed.
2. Run `pnpm install` (after T-002 adds workspace config).
3. See upcoming tasks for service & app bootstrapping.

## Governance

- Strong typing & runtime validation at boundaries.
- No unchecked `any`; follow `.github/COPILOT_STEERING.md`.
- Each task references an ID from `docs/tasks.md`.
- Security baseline: see `docs/security-baseline.md` (T-013).

## Next Steps

Phase 1 tasks complete through T-015 (Foundations). Post-phase 1 hardening tasks (T-016â€“T-019) added: test utilities, OpenAPI lint, config schema, developer guide.

Initial scaffold created for T-001; workspace config added T-002. See `docs/developer-guide.md` for detailed contributor instructions.
